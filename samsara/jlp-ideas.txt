Ideas:
- I think obstacles inspired by the lap environment itself might be visually interesting at least
(boiling beakers, spilled chemicals, etc).
- Could have a whole flypaper level which slows you down or the really goopy stuff kills you
- Would it be crazy to have a powerup that lets you jump/fly more than a single square? Might be an
irritating change of the 'model' to code around.
- I suppose a fertility powerup might be interesting (resulting in more eggs). Could be an
infertility powerdown as well
- I seem to remember that one of the things you could select for when breeding fruit flies was eye
color.. could have the eye color change in a fly which gives them the ability to see things they
couldn't before.. (maybe they can get a hint what direction the spider is moving to next, or see
hidden things).
- I suppose a fly could become stronger, able to push smaller obstacles out of the way.
- There could be the adrenaline powerup, being able to move faster (more squares at once?)
- I'll keep thinking...

# Prototype meetup ideas

## Aug 16, 2015

- Powerups
  - grant more moves
  - make you invincible for a brief period (Mario star)

- Fruit: acts as a powerup, is in theme
  - mate while powered up == 2x eggs
  - attacked while power up, don't die but powerup stops

- Spiders leave strands, or somehow sticky spots end up on board which "eat" one move

- Use eggs as lure (enemies move toward eggs)
  - or use eggs as consumable resource (tradeoff security of respawn point for reward)
  - eating eggs could provide power up

- Maybe eggs are at risk of attack by board enemies; have to spend life to protect them

- Poison left on board kills, but evaporates after N turns

- Allow fly to carry eggs after mating
  - can drop them in safer spot
  - if you die while carrying eggs, eggs are lost

- Check out game: Life goes on

- Variation in mates
  - some yield eggs with longer lifespan
  - some yield eggs that are stronger (>1 HP)
  - some yield eggs that can hop one tile
  - ??

- Input:
  - virtual joypad (in lower left or lower right)

- Walk into sleeping (or awake) spider to splat it
  - solves problem of being trapped by sleeping spider

- How to work around impassable frogs?
  - maybe make them sleep after they've eaten two creatures?
  - maybe walk into them to stun them (splatting fly in process)
